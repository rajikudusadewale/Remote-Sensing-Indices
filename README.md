# Remote-Sensing-Indices
##Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)

**Project: Spatio-Temporal Analysis.**

**Overview:** Used R to automate spatio-temporal processes. 
To measure vegetation and water content, two remote sensing indices were carried out, namely; Normalized Difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference water index (NDWI) using Landsat 7 & 5 Imageries of 1999, 2008, and 2018 for dry and wet seasons. 

**Study Area**:Kainji Lake, Nigeria

**Data Source**: United States Geological Surveys (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

**NDVI** and **NDWI** are two different indices used to analyze remote sensing data, often from satellite imagery, to measure vegetation and water content respectively.

NDVI stands for "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index". It is calculated using **near-infrared (NIR)** and **red light bands** from remote sensing data and provides a measure of the amount and health of vegetation in an area. NDVI values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating a greater amount of healthy vegetation.

NDWI stands for "Normalized Difference Water Index". It is calculated using **near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands** from remote sensing data and provides a measure of the presence and extent of water in an area. NDWI values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating a greater amount of water content.

Both NDVI and NDWI are widely used in various applications, including agriculture, hydrology, and ecology, to monitor changes in vegetation and water content over time and space. 

Histogram charts were created to:
1. check the distrubution of pixels of Kainji Lake for each studied years (1999, 2008, & 2018)
2. to compare the distribution of pixels of both dry and wet seasons for each years.
